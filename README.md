*Synia-s2s (speech2speech): Vocalized Conversational AI*

### Abstract
Synia-s2s is a conversational AI chatbot that you can talk to with your voice, and it will talk back. Synia-s2s is a continuation of Synia-t2t (text2text).

### Usage
There are a wide variety of uses that are still being explored in an appropriate scope. The goals with this project was to take the amazing results from Synia-t2t and recreate it in a more natural and believable medium just like a human conversation.

### Limitations
There are many nuances to human conversation that could not be replicated with the same accuracy with a chatbot, but are being worked on and continue to become more comparable every day.
